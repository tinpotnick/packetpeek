# packetpeek
Web application which can read pcap files and do something useful with them.

At the moment, this is a very basic intro. It doesn't really work with large files
yet as dynamic loading as you scroll through data needs supporting.

Also, support for looking for traffic of different types.

My goal is to use this as a tool to analyse capture files for applications such as VOIP.

Currently it has a basic function to dray a traffic ladder diagram using D3 JS.
